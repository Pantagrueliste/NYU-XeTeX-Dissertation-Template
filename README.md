## NYU-XeTeX-Dissertation-Template
This XeTeX template is designed for doctoral dissertations that need to comply with the strict [formatting guidelines](http://gsas.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/gsas/documents/dissertationsubmissionrelated/Doctoral%20Dissertation%20Formatting%20Requirements%2010-09-15.pdf "formatting guidelines") of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. 

### Why is this template helpful
1. You're a busy Ph.D. candidate? Chances are you don't want to waste time with Byzantine format requirements.
2. You work in the humanities? Scholars in the humanities have specific needs, and this template is tries to address many of them, including unicode compatibility, multilingual support, and advanced typographic features.
3. This template also makes the required inclusion of a separate list of appendices---and its consequent exclusion from the table of contents---possible.  

### Things you need to verify before using this template
1. Your adviser is ready and willing to work in a format that is fundamentally incompatible with Microsoft Word.
  * You can use pandoc to convert a LaTeX file into a .docx, but you will not be able to track changes.
  * You can try using diff to compare two .pdf files, but chances are that your adviser neither has the remotest idea of how this might work, nor the time and/or will to learn.
2. NYU GSAS has not amended its formatting rules since the creation of this template.
  * If they do, please send me a message.
3. Last but not the least, I highly recommended the use Git to keep track of changes.
  * Write one sentence per line
  * Divide your dissertation in multiple files.
  * Send commits without moderation.
  * Create [a proper .gitignore file](https://gist.github.com/kogakure/149016 "a proper .gitignore file") to exclude autogenerated files.
